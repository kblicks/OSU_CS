Assignment #3 Zoo Tycoon

Description: This program allows you to play a game called Zoo tycoon. The player takes charge of an empty zoo with $50,000
in the bank. It's up to the player to buy and sell animals and not go bankrupt. Each animal can generate attendance revenue, 
but they will also have a feeding costs. The player loses if they run out of money, and they will if they can make $500,000.

Each month a player will earn revenue based on attendance and what animals are in the zoo. A special event will occur. 
There are three special events where one animal can get sick, a randomly chosen animal will give birth, or a boom in zoo attendance.
When an animal gets sick, the money needed to cure the animal is withdrawn from the bank. If the player doesn't have enough money,
then the sick animal will die. Each species can give birth to a specific number of babies and those babies will be added to the zoo. 
Only adults aged 2+ years can give birth. Babies have different traits and adults. A boom in zoo attendance will double the attendance for
that month and double the feeding cost. 

The player can choose to buy up to two animals of the same species each month. They may also sell 1 animal of any species. 
Each month counts as a turn and the game will continue until the game over condition is met.
